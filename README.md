# caddy-redis

This package is a plugin for the [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com) webserver. Its purpose is to store and retrieve user data in and from Redis.

If you HTTP POST a valid JSON payload to `/redis/<key>`, it will put it into a Redis database under the specified key.

Similarly, if you do a HTTP GET on `/redis/<key>`, it will return the previously stored data. If you specify a `Accept-Encoding` header of `application/xml`, it will return the data as XML, otherwise as JSON.

**WARNING:** This plugin is for testing purposes only. **Do not use in production!** Seriously, this plugin will write anything given by anyone to the specified Redis database. You'll want to implement some kind of authentication at the very least.

## Sample usage

### Storing data

`curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"key":"val"}' http://localhost:2015/redis/test`

This will SET `caddy:test => "{"key":"val"}"` in Redis.

### Retrieving data

`curl -H "Accept-Encoding: application/json" http://localhost:2015/redis/test`

This will GET the previously stored data for the key `test` as JSON.

`curl -H "Accept-Encoding: application/xml" http://localhost:2015/redis/test`

This will GET the previously stored data for the key `test` as XML.

## Syntax

```
redis  {
	server localhost:6379 	# NOTE: If not specified, ":6379" is used as the Redis server (default).
	password foobar 		# NOTE: If not specified, Redis is used without authentication (default).
}
```
